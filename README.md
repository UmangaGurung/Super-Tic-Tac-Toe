# SuperTicTacToe

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and an `ApplicationAdapter` extension that draws libGDX logo.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.

# Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmangaGurung/Super-Tic-Tac-Toe
   ```

2. Place the assets folder in the correct location:

   After cloning the repository, you must copy the assets folder and place it in the following directory within your project structure:
   
   `lwjgl3/src/main/resources/`

   Important: If you do not perform this step, the project will fail to run because the necessary assets (e.g., uiskin.json, textures, fonts) will be missing, resulting in errors such as:
   
   `com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SerializationException: Error reading file: assets/uiskin.json`

3. Build and Run:

Follow the usual steps to build and run the project in your IDE.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
